To update linked models without closing the current project, you can reload the linked models. Unload linked models to temporarily remove them from the project.

1 Click Manage tabManage Project panel (Manage Links).
2 In the Manage Links dialog, click the relevant tab.
3 Select the linked model.
4 To unload the selected model, click Unload. Click Yes to confirm.
  Note: It is not required that you unload a linked model before reloading.
5 Optional for Revit Links only: For worksharing-enabled models, when in a local file, click Unload for me to unload the linked model for the current user only. This command works like a permanent override and remains set for the user, for that RVT link, until cleared with the "Clear my override" command. The setting is stored in the central model, per user for each RVT link.
  Note: This feature is available only to students and to Autodesk Maintenance and Desktop Subscription customers for Revit 2016 software releases.
6 To reload the selected model, click Reload.
  Note: If you reload a linked CAD file that references a view that is no longer available, you will be prompted to choose a different view. When reloading a link to a CAD file, be sure to review the reloaded link carefully. View data from the CAD file is used to convert the file into a form usable in Revit. For example, changing the view reference may affect how the link is displayed or positioned in Revit.
